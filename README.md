# Please send help, they're making me write readmes
This notebook has a code block that takes a name input, preferrably of the person you're sending to save me.
It'll also take a number of seconds, which, ideally, represents my savior's estimated time of arrival.
Then, the notebook's codeblock will wait patiently to tell you that the object of your heroics (me) is in another castle.

An unfortunate turn of events, to be sure.
